# Snake, Gun, Water Game

This is a Python-based Snake, Gun, Water game implemented in VS Code. The game is a fun and simple variation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game, where players can compete against the computer.


# Description
The Snake, Gun, Water game is a command-line game where the player plays against the computer. The player can choose between three options: Snake, Gun, or Water. The computer randomly chooses one of the three as well. The winner is determined based on the rules defined below.

This project is implemented in Python and provides a simple yet engaging experience. It's an excellent way to learn about Python programming, random number generation, and conditional statements.
# How to Play
__1.__ Run the Python script in your terminal.

__2.__ Choose between Snake, Gun, or Water by typing the corresponding word.

__3.__ The computer will also choose between Snake, Gun, or Water.

__4.__ The winner will be determined based on the game rules.

__5.__ You can play multiple rounds and see who wins the most rounds.

# Rules
__Snake vs. Water:__ Snake drinks water, so Snake wins.

__Snake vs. Gun:__ Gun shoots the snake, so Gun wins.

__Gun vs. Water:__ Water douses the gun, so Water wins.

The game is based on these simple rules, and each round has a clear winner or ends in a draw if both the player and the computer choose the same option.

# Usage
Once you run the script, follow the on-screen instructions to play the game. Enter your choice when prompted, and the computer will generate its choice. The game will announce the winner of each round.
